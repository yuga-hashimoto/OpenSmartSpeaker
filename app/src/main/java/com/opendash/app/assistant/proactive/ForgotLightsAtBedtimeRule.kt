/**
 * Once the clock is past [BEDTIME_HOUR], surface a suggestion if any
 * Home Assistant light is still reporting `isOn == true`. The intent
 * is the "did you forget to turn off the lamp in the living room?"
 * nudge — gentle, single-shot, actionable.
 *
 * Dedupe: the suggestion id mixes the set of on-light names so the
 * nudge re-surfaces only when the *set* of on-lights changes. That
 * way dismissing the card and then leaving the lights on won't spam
 * the user, but turning off some lights and leaving others on does
 * refresh the suggestion.
 *
 * The rule does not act — it only suggests. `execute_command` with
 * "turn off all lights" belongs to the user's acceptance tap.
